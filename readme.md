# Cardwall App
The goal of the app is to allow users the ability to manage a series of cards and drag/drop these amongst a set of columns. This is an implementation of a kanban board using a React app. Here are the ideal requirements for the first version of this app.

- View a set of cards and columns
- View a specific card with a greater set of details
- Create a new card
- Search across the cards in the current view
- Drag and drop cards from one column to another
